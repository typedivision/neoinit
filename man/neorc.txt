neorc(8)                           System Manager's Manual                          neorc(8)

NAME
       neorc - neoinit run control

SYNOPSIS
       neorc [OPTIONS] SERVICE...

DESCRIPTION
       neorc  is  the management interface to neoinit.  SERVICE is a directory name relative
       to /etc/neoinit (can also include /etc/neoinit/ in the service name).

OPTIONS
       If no option is given, neorc will just print a small diagnostic  message  to  stdout,
       saying  if  the service is up, down, finished or failed, and for how long it has been
       in that state.

       -o   Once.  If the service is not running, start it.  If it stops, do not restart it.

       -u   Up.  If the service is not running, start it.  If it stops, restart it.

       -d   Down.  If the service is running, send it a TERM signal and then a CONT  signal.
            After it stops, do not restart it.

       -R   Enable respawn.  Set respawn option.  This does not start/stop the service.

       -r   Disable respawn.  Unset respawn option.  This does not start/stop the service.

       -t   Terminate.  Send the service a TERM signal.

       -k   Kill.  Send the service a KILL signal.

       -g   Get PID.  Just print the PID of the service if it is running.

       -C   Clear.  If the service is finished, reset its state.  This is useful if a depen‚Äê
            dency of a service should be started again together with that service.

       -P pid
            Set PID.  Tell neoinit the PID of the service.  This is useful for services that
            fork themselves in the background with a new PID to supervise.

       -D   Print  dependencies.   This  will  print the names of all the services that were
            started because this services depended on them.  Please note that  this  is  not
            done recursively, only direct dependencies are listed.

       -H   Print  history.   This will print the names of the last spawned processes.  This
            can be helpful if you see a process looping  (initialization  fails  and  it  is
            restarting all the time).

       -L   List services.  This will print the name, state and the time since it is in this
            state of all services.

EXIT STATUS
       Generally,  neorc  returns 0 if everything is ok or 1 if an error has occurred (could
       not  open  /etc/neoinit/in  or /etc/neoinit/out or there is no service with the given
       name).
